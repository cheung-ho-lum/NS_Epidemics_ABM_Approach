data sources
---
some research topics:
spread of covid across countries or cities based on transportation networks <or perhaps social networks>
why? who would be interested?
perhaps by states and the transportation networks along the states?
<yes, we need reliable data>
perhaps we can look at Spain?
- we have the data for infected people per day per region in spain.


subtopic: mobility  measures vs. r0/spread of disease
NYC subway ridership and efficacy of closing subways

what people would like to work on

general expertise areas:
dimas - collect data, visualization, good at ML
elie - exploratory data analysis, report (so like visualizations and descriptive statistics)
leroy - report, code validation, general ideas, interacting with other teams, 
larry - write code
- data collection
-- gather necessary data
--...? format it for language and platform.
- coding
-- (analyzes data, makes networks, has variables we can play with)
- report
-- graphs, plots,visualizations

timeline:
may 25 - discuss the problem
may 28 - finalize initial research topic area.
jun 1  - fully formulate and propose the problem to zhukov.
jun 8  - data collection almost done. preliminary model built. 
jun 15 - preliminary analysis done. <model being refined>
jun 22 - best forecasting conclusions made.
jun 27 - final due date / defense (.: report is written)

*preliminary analysis = descriptive statistics, and how well our prelim model works given no changes.
