who:
prj team + zhukov + makarov

why:
1) answer how we want to do check-in 
2) discuss issues with scope (or selection) of research topic and details. and 
3) actually do a check-in

Leroy
- Reviewed Netlogo and MESA ABM tools
- read some general epidemic modelling articles and added some new citations and
- prototyped a mesa ABM model in python
- reviewed MTA turnstile data
>< - unclear on the ... basic parameters of our model
+ continue writing report and conversing with people to get a clear picture of what and why we are doing this.

Dimas
- Looked for data sources for spain, usa, and russia.
- Tried to understand USA census data
>< - frustrated by lack of documentation on data
+ 

Frank
- Read the 'working paper' 
- read the abstract/report
- read about MESA
>< waiting for the meeting in 10mins

ABMs.

w/zhukov, makarov:
discuss, outline project timeline and scope

discussion:
3+4 combined (at least for discussion)
not just subways? - other mass transport networks
stations as nodes [with some percentage of infection], traffic are edges. passenger flow is the edge thickness, 
-=or=- (humans as agents)
time-dependent links of people on their subway rides.
-=or=- (lines as agents?!)

some possible different ideas:
- predicting moscow metro entries based on mesh data
- scraping vk, other sn like fb (not recommended, small networks)

==some confusion about what models
>let's try a model which uses network and what doesn't

3: general ABM
4: with network structure





next steps:
based on the limited time: try to reproduce previous experiments.
> calculate probability of being infected per station.

some questions/comments to bring up
1) btw, it is 'compartment'.
2) question: compare project prompt and proposed topic
-- particularly, are we fitting the model right to answer the question
3) question: best compartmental model (fits COVID)
-- the big question is how it models contagious period. 
4) question: best ABM software
