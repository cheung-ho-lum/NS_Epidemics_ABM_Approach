# Stage 1:
# Just the map and people
# Create station map
# Add an above-ground node for people in the zip. These people don't interact (for now)
# Use MESA to make our Model
# Have people move around the subway
# End stage 1
# Stage 2:
# Introduce SEIR and add some numbers
# Introduce the NYC Subway map and add attributes
# Stage 2a:
# Introduce a secondary mapping of weighted edges based on ridership
# A sidenote that turnstiles don't count transfers. t.e. while we map ridership between nodes
# They almost always take some specific path through the network
# Although... the gridlike structure of nyc subway may make multiple choices viable. TBD
# Stage 3:
# make agents move based on commuting (give them a home)
# make agents infect *stations* for an amount of time, and not directly infect other agents
# fix the line data
# Stage 3.5:
# build some other subway maps.
# Stage 3.6:
# total passenger flow now calculated
# riders spawned by ratio of their station to the total
# Some code cleanup (give map types an enum, create DisplayParams)
# Stage 3.6.5:
# Evaluate and pull out what is common to agents on all types of transportation
# Create Generic Transportation Model
# Refactor SubwayModel to inherit from TransportationModel
# Stage 3.6.6:
# Redo agents to best mimic a population at a station.
# Stage 3.7:
# More code cleanup: It's time preprocessing just created an OurGraph
# Clean up passenger flow calculations
# Stage 3.9:
# Refactor and clean up data folder.
# Code cleanup: Model should really handle more of its own graphics
# Stage 4:
# Implement Basic quarantine modelling
# Distinguish between population and flow
# Stage 4.1:
# Generalize the idea of eccentricity
# Check Moscow Metro for validity of this idea
# Stage 4.2
# Get real population numbers living at each metro station (vs. ridership)
# Draw zip-level (or borough) detail onto the map
# Get zip-level (or borough) data of the spread of coronavirus
# Stage 4.2
# Fit the model.
# Stage 6:
# Give agents some work data
# Spread of viral load should be diminished by number of routes
