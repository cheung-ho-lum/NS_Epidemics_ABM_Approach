From the working article, we can use many estimated data, e.g.:
- Interactions of a person per day and per place.
- Probability that a person infects to others.

Some news are useful to make assumptions:
- "Of the passengers who tested positive, 81% had no symptoms." - https://translate.google.es/translate?sl=es&tl=en&u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.elmundo.es%2Fciencia-y-salud%2Fsalud%2F2020%2F05%2F28%2F5eceec8afdddffc1bd8b45f7.html

Perhaps moscow metro also publishes their data? Probably not. Maybe bogus anyway.

Dimas' note: I've tried to find reliable info about metro workload, but I did not succeed.
Maybe this? https://www.mosoblreclama.ru/auxpage_passazhiropotok_metro

Moscow metro data (entrance/exits) available in json, xlsx and a bunch of other methods.:
