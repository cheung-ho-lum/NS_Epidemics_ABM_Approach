Intro
- Group
- What

ToC
- Focus NYC
- prior researfch, other models

Motivation
- read questions
- mention 'lines' idea

London UG
- variety of models
- granularity: day, boroughs
- population islington more exposed than chelsea
- backed by flu statistics

COVID London
-whoops

Singapore Buses
- time dependent link. similar to cercanias
- networks enable/limit contact
- research with contact measures

ABM Framework
- MESA, an OOP programmer's solution. Describe complex environment and agent behavior.
- Transportation Model incorporates networkx
- SEIR Agent incorporates full compartmental mixing

Simple Geometries
- Exploration to define: 
-- What makes subways different
-- How are they similar

WAN (Handoff)
- Explain WAN
- Ask Larry to explain passenger flow

...
...


WAN (Handoff)
- See that disease spreads domestically in china first
- Enters Spain from Madrid, and USA through NYC/LAX. 

Madrid Commuter Trains (Handoff)
- Commuter rails. Electrichki. 

...
...
...

Madrid Commuter Trains (Handoff)
- Rush hour matters

New York City
Reminder: Why COVID is more prevalent in some areas
- Yes, people commute by subway
- Quarantine Measure Fitting
- Terminology for areas of NYC

Subway Systems
Complex = Novokuznetskaya + Tretyakovskaya
Station = Novokuznetskaya
Line, Route = 1:1 here. филёвская

NYC Subway Data
Station - List of station and their lines
Map - Routing through the station list. Service S
Turnstile - In/Out of every station. 
* Be careful when parsing data

NYC Subway Modeling
- Simplified, and not how it's coded
- Agents, exposure
-- Why agents don't move
- Complexes, a few added components to graph

Hyperparameters
- Countermeasures
- SEIR Settings
- A defense of bloat
-- work-in-progress
-- lots of requests
-- fits well

Fit 1
-- it fits, MAPE
-- well duh, with all the hyperparameters

Fit 2
-- it fits significantly worse
-- but you can see that there is some predictive value

Discussion
-- Scrap a lot of these parameters/hyperparameters
-- Used MAPE because it was suggested, might use some other metric

Conclusions
-- WAN passenger flow dictates that international airports are the 'port-of-entry' for viruses.
-- Rush hour and central hubs are largely responsible for disease spread.  
-- Lines and commute time are correlated to the prevalence of coronavirus.
